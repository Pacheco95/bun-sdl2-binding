# bun-sdl2-binding

This is an attempt to create a SDL2 binding for Bun, and it's my first time using FFI, so please, don't judge me!

---

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

To run tests
```bash
bun test --coverage
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.7. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
